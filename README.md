# FizzBuzzChallenge
Fizz Buzz is a very simple programming task, asked in software developer job interviews.

Q. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100
1. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number
2. For the multiples of 5, print "Buzz"
3. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

For example
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz... n
